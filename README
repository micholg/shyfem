Directory structure
===================

examples	example applications
fem3d		FEM model and utility routines
femadj		Routines for the adjustment of the grid after the
		automatic mesh generation. The program to run is shyadj.
femanim		Routines to generate animations from postscript files
fembin		Binaries used by the model
femcheck	Routines to set up and check the installation
femdoc		Documentation, manual, etc.
femdummy	Dummy directory
femersem	Routines for BFM (ERSEM) ecological model
femgotm		Routines for GOTM turbulence clousre model
femlib		Library routines (populated during compilation)
femplot		Plotting routines for post processing. The routine
		to run is shyplot.
femregres	Routines to do regression testing. Developers only.
femutil		Various utility programs
grid		Visualization routine for GRD files
hcbs		Outdated files for plotting to monitor
mesh		Automatic mesh generator
post		Library for plotting to Postscript files.
tmp		Temporary directory

Compiling the model
===================

You can compile everything from the SHYFEM directory by running the
command "make fem". Other commands are:

make help	gives help on available make targets
make fem	compiles everything
make doc	makes documentation in femdoc (manual)
make all	compiles (shyfem) and makes documents (doc)
make clean	deletes objetc and executable files in all subdirectories
make cleanall	as clean, but cleans also libraries
